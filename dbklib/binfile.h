	// In C, the unsigned char data type is the only data type:
	// 1) that has no padding bits; all storage bits contribute to the value.  
	// 2) for which no bitwise operation starting from a value of that type, when converted
	//    back into that type, can produce overflow, trap representations or 
	//    undefined behavior.
	//    There is no permutation of the bit sequence that produces overflow, trap 
	//    representations or undefined behavior.  
	// 3) that may alias other data types without violating the "aliasing rules;" 
	//    access to the same data through a pointer that is typed differently will be 
	//    guaranteed to see all modifications.  
	//
